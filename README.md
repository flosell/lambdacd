* it's a continuous delivery pipeline, in code
* it's your own custom built Jenkins/Go/TeamCity/..., in clojure


## Status

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lambdacd/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/lambdacd)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd)

## Getting started

* Make sure you have [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) and a recent version of 
  [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed
* `lein new lambdacd <NAME>` will create a new pipeline-project
* `cd <NAME>`
* `lein run` downloads all dependencies and starts the server; the UI is then served on on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* your pipeline is defined in `src/<NAME>/`. Have a look around, change some steps or add some steps on your own
* For more details, check out the resources and related projects below 


## Example

```clojure
;; buildsteps
(def some-repo "git@github.com:flosell/somerepo")

(defn wait-for-repo [_ ctx]
  (git/wait-for-git ctx some-repo "master"))

(defn ^{:display-type :container} with-repo [& steps]
  (git/with-git some-repo steps))

(defn run-tests [{cwd :cwd} ctx]
  (shell/bash ctx cwd
    "lein test"))

(defn compile-and-deploy [{cwd :cwd} ctx]
  (shell/bash ctx cwd
    "./buildscripts/compile-and-deploy.sh"))

;; the pipeline
(def pipeline
  `(
     (either
       wait-for-manual-trigger
       wait-for-repo)
     (with-repo
       run-tests
       compile-and-deploy)))
```

## Development

LambdaCD is built in Clojure and ClojureScript with [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) as a build-tool.
The `./go` script is your main entry-point that wraps all important development tasks.
Call it without arguments to see all the options.

### General Setup 

* Call `./go setup` to install necessary dependencies and build everything once. 

### Core Development

* Sources for the core of LambdaCD can be found in `src/clj`, tests in `test/clj`.
* Run tests with `./go test-clj`
* To run a sample-pipeline (see `example/clj`), run `./go serve`. You may have to run `./go serve-cljs` occasionally to
  generate the frontend JS code from ClojureScript.
* If you want the example pipeline to be green (which is not necessary for all development), you first need to setup a
  mock-deployment environment on your machine (two VMs where we deploy a TodoMVC client and server):
  * install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  * have github-access set up (you need to be able to clone with ssh)
  * `./go setupTodopipelineEnv` starts up two VMs in vagrant where we deploy to and exports the ssh-config for them so that it can be used by the deployment scripts

### Frontend Development

* The frontend is written in ClojureScript using [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) and [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
* Frontend resources can be found in `resources/public`, ClojureScript code in `src/cljs`, tests in `test/cljs`
* Stylesheets are written in are in [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and can be found in `src/less`
* ClojureScript code needs to be compiled into JS before being useful
* In three terminals, run `./go serve` to start an example pipeline (if you want it to be green, follow the environment
  setup above), `./go serve-cljs` to start a ClojureScript REPL and automatic code-reloading using
  [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) and `./go serve-css` to run the css autoprefixer watch
* Run `./go test-cljs` to run frontend-tests or `./go test-cljs-auto` to start autotest
