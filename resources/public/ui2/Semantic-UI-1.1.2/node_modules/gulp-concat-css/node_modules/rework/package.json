  "readme": "# rework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reworkcss/rework.png)](https://travis-ci.org/reworkcss/rework)\n\nCSS manipulations built on [`css`](https://github.com/reworkcss/css), allowing\nyou to automate vendor prefixing, create your own properties, inline images,\nanything you can imagine!\n\nPlease refer to [`css`](https://github.com/reworkcss/css) for AST documentation\nand to report parser/stringifier issues.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install rework\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar rework = require('rework');\nvar pluginA = require('pluginA');\nvar pluginB = require('pluginB');\n\nrework('body { font-size: 12px; }', { source: 'source.css' })\n  .use(pluginA)\n  .use(pluginB)\n  .toString({ sourcemap: true })\n```\n\n## API\n\n### rework(code, [options])\n\nAccepts a CSS string and returns a new `Rework` instance. The `options` are\npassed directly to `css.parse`.\n\n### Rework#use(fn)\n\nUse the given plugin `fn`. A rework \"plugin\" is simply a function accepting the\nstylesheet root node and the `Rework` instance.\n\n### Rework#toString([options])\n\nReturns the string representation of the manipulated CSS. The `options` are\npassed directly to `css.stringify`.\n\nUnlike `css.stringify`, if you pass `sourcemap: true` a string will still be\nreturned, with the source map inlined. Also use `sourcemapAsObject: true` if\nyou want the `css.stringify` return value.\n\n## Plugins\n\nRework has a rich collection of plugins and mixins.
